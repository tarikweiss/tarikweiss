# Hi 👋🏽, I'm Tarik 😊

... and this is my little profile guide.

## Speaking computer

Programming is an almost lifetime passion of me, which I discovered with playing [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).
Everything started with the first little modifications in-game and led to my current job.

Today I'm a software-engineer at Immoware24 and my guilty pleasure is speaking IMAP almost fluently.
That why I'm responsible for e-mail related products in our company, developing new features and continuously improving the user experience.

In my free time I'm realising projects with Swift and SwiftUI as well as Kotlin. I like Swift, as well as Kotlin for their
fluent working concepts and as I'm originated in Java, Kotlin works like a charm for me!

You may find some of my work in the Apple App Store.

## Music

Music is a must-have companion in my live. I have special interest in Techno music,
but I also like House, Gabber and Classic. Producing is my passion, next to programming.
Those to hobbies have a special symbiosis for me and if you want to have a listen you may
head over to my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/tarikweiss) profile.
